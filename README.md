Daily Day Planner

This is a daily day planner using an input form for each hour of the day, 9-5, to allow the user to enter a task or appointment and save that data to their local storage. I established an initial input form in the html, 9am, an cloned that form in the javascript. On the input form, is drop down button that allows the user to select "Working On" to change the color of of their entry, as well as "Complete" which does the same, and "Save" which saves the input data. Save not only saves the input but the color they selected for the entry. I added a line from Moment.js to keep a running clock and display the day's date. I added little instructions about the colors used in the form and note about local storage for users. Also, a "Clear Data" button that allows the user to clear their local storage. As I write this, I realize the color scheme may be a bit wonky but I was first playing with some .css styles :) Oh, I also added my signature favicon.
